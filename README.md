# KataBankOCR

This is a ruby solution for the problem called KataBankOCR found on

<http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataBankOCR>

Only user stories 1, 2 and 3 are implemented. User story 4 is left for the curiousâ€¦

## How to test

A test file 'test.txt" contains test cases, and a spec file is in place, so you can just run
'rspec' and see the tests pass.

Bear in mind that the input file format is whitespace sensitive, so disable any cleanups
your editor might be doing upon saving.

You can run:

    ./account_number_spec.rb test.txt

on a shell to see the output. Debug messages for unreadable digits are on by default.
